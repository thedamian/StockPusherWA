# Stock Pusher WhatsAPP

Polls every 5 minutes. 
if your stock is higher or lower (you tell me) then I send you a whatsapp message with the notification.

# What service api keys you'll need.
- Get a developer key from [IexCloud](https://iexcloud.io/) and add it to your .env file
- get a developer TWILIO Account ID and AUTH TOKEN from [Twilio.com](www.twilio.com/referral/XOGfeb) (Free $20 from that link) and add it to your .env file

## To run it just:
- rename .env.example to .env 
- Enter your iexcloud and twillio keys in your new .env file
- npm i
- npm start

Enjoy!
